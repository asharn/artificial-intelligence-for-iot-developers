## Assess Effects on End User Needs

Lighting, model accuracy, and camera focal length/image size have different effects on a
deployed edge model. The potential effects of each of these are as follows...

## Model Research

[This heading is only required if a suitable model was not found after trying out at least three
different models. However, you may also use this heading to detail how you converted 
a successful model.]

In investigating potential people counter models, I tried each of the following three models:

- Model 1: Faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28
  - http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28.tar.gz
    - I converted the model to an Intermediate Representation with the following arguments and commands '''python /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/mo.py --input_model ssd_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28/frozen_inference_graph.pb --tensorflow_object_detection_api_pipeline_config pipeline.config --reverse_input_channels --tensorflow_use_custom_operations_config /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/extensions/front/tf/ssd_v2_support.json'''
  - The model was insufficient for the app because each time I was trying to run app it was showing segmentation fault.
  - I tried to improve the model for the app by using different theashold but result where not fruitful.

- Model 2: ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29
  - http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29.tar.gz
  - I converted the model to an Intermediate Representation with the following arguments of the command '''python /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/mo.py --input_model faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28/frozen_inference_graph.pb --tensorflow_object_detection_api_pipeline_config pipeline.config --reverse_input_channels --tensorflow_use_custom_operations_config /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/extensions/front/tf/faster_rcnn_support.json'''
  - The model was sufficiant for the app because it was able to recognize accuratly people.
  - I tried to improve the model for the app by using different theashold and found that there was accuracy increase with duration of time also.
  

- Model 3: [Name]
  - [Model Source]
  - I converted the model to an Intermediate Representation with the following arguments...
  - The model was insufficient for the app because...
  - I tried to improve the model for the app by...
